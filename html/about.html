            <p>
              I am a seasoned Web Developer and Project Coordinator with over 4
              years of experience in diverse environments, ranging from
              freelance projects to corporate settings. My skill set includes
              proficiency in web development technologies such as JavaScript,
              ReactJS, CSS, and WordPress, complemented by my expertise in
              project management tools like Jira and MS Project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am passionate about tackling complex projects with a
              detail-focused approach, ensuring optimal performance and
              stakeholder satisfaction. Throughout my career, I have
              successfully managed and delivered projects that have enhanced
              user experiences and streamlined operations for clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive on continuous learning and innovation, keeping pace with
              emerging technologies and industry trends to deliver cutting-edge
              solutions. My commitment to quality and problem-solving allows me
              to bridge technical requirements with stakeholder expectations
              effectively.

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
              After lots of research, I think that the right step forward is to
              become more adept, both technically and aesthetically. My current
              focus is on mastering Next.js through hands-on learning and
              project development. I am dedicated to building a robust portfolio
              that showcases my proficiency in Next.js and demonstrates my
              ability to create innovative and responsive web applications.
              However, I like to be flexible and await new and intriguing
              challenges in the future.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up, films were my choice of escapism. Over time, my
              appreciation for cinema has evolved, and I've become somewhat of a
              cinephile. I enjoy exploring films from various countries and
              languages, with classics like
              <strong>12 Angry Men</strong> holding a special place in my heart.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not good to sit at your desk all day. Therefore, I try to go
              for a walk everyday and listen to some podcasts along the way.
              Feel free to reach out if you're looking for recommendations.
