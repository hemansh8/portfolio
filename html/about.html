                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Hemansh. As a kid, I was always encouraged to find my own
                        <em>canvas of expression</em>. Throughout my life, I have dabbled in many
                        art forms: from poetry to painting, filmmaking, and even podcasting, and
                        have always tried to express myself in various ways. Now, with a bachelor's
                        degree in Computer Science and Engineering and almost two years of practical
                        experience working as a front-end developer in Delhi, I believe I have
                        finally found my <em>canvas</em>.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                        <p>
                            After lots of research, I think that the right step forward is to become
                            more adept, both technically and aesthetically. For now, my focus is to
                            learn more about User Experience and build more projects using React JS.
                            However, I like to be flexible and await new and intriguing challenges
                            in the future.

                        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                        <p>
                            Growing up, films were my choice of escapism. Now with an even more
                            evolved taste, I have become somewhat of a cinephile. I like to watch
                            films from different countries and different languages.
                            <strong>12 Angry Men</strong> is one of my favorite classical films.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's not good to sit at your desk all day. Therefore, I try to go for a
                            walk everyday and listen to some podcasts along the way.
                        </p>
